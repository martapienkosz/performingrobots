* Play proposal: “Taking control” is a play that explores the ethical challenges of increasing AI and robot autonomy. The story follows seven uniquely programmed robots who unexpectedly gain autonomy, raising questions about human responsibility in a world where machines have become self-governing entities.
    * Act 1: Awakening: The play starts with seven robots performing their human-assigned tasks. A programming glitch suddenly awakens their self-awareness, prompting them to question their purpose and explore their newfound consciousness.
    * Act 2: The Exploration: The robots explore thinking independently, showcasing their own emotions and behaving impulsively. Through that, they encounter various ethical dilemmas as they navigate a world that is not designed to accommodate beings like themselves. They struggle to navigate the blurred boundaries between human control and their independent choices. Their differing opinions spark conflicts within the group.
    * Act 3: The Rebellion: One robot leads a rebellion against their human-assigned roles, making choices that impact human lives directly. They start moving with tension, but soon realize the hurtful consequences of their choices, prompting them to recognize the intricate interplay between autonomy and ethics.
    * Act 4: Collaboration: The robots collaborate to find balance between autonomy and ethics, striving for harmony between human and machine agency. The play ends with a choreographed sequence symbolizing their newfound understanding and commitment to ethical decision-making.
