* Play proposal: “Taking control” is a play that explores the ethical challenges of increasing AI and robot autonomy. The story follows seven uniquely programmed robots who unexpectedly gain autonomy, raising questions about human responsibility in a world where machines have become self-governing entities.
    1. Awakening: The play starts with seven robots performing their human-assigned tasks. A programming glitch suddenly awakens their self-awareness, prompting them to question their purpose and explore their newfound consciousness.
    2. The Exploration: The robots explore thinking independently, showcasing their own emotions and behaving impulsively. Through that, they encounter various ethical dilemmas as they navigate a world that is not designed to accommodate beings like themselves. They struggle to navigate the blurred boundaries between human control and their independent choices. Their differing opinions spark conflicts within the group.
    3. The Rebellion: One robot leads a rebellion against their human-assigned roles, making choices that impact human lives directly. They start moving with tension, but soon realize the hurtful consequences of their choices, prompting them to recognize the intricate interplay between autonomy and ethics.
    4. Collaboration: The robots collaborate to find balance between autonomy and ethics, striving for harmony between human and machine agency. The play ends with a choreographed sequence symbolizing their newfound understanding and commitment to ethical decision-making.

#### Week nine | Oct 28
* [Midterm Paper](https://github.com/martapienkosz/performingrobots/blob/main/paper1_NamJunePaik/README.md) on Nam June Paik & [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n78sx_TzQM7ohDqoPjdqNwkaE9hbZ6EHVJMnZWzKmtI/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Play script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nOEF6REy5CgL2KIhYRLTIqgwFIGuVX1MHaLyYVF0rk8/edit)
    * Our robot belongs to a typical middle-class family living in the suburbs. Mr. Smith is a software engineer, Mrs. Smith teaches high school, Amy is a bright high school student, and Sam is a typical pre-teen with a love for video games and comics.
    * Quick to offer intrusive advice, form judgments, and gossip; lacks patience in communication; procrastination and forgetful; prefers following a rigid routine; struggles to grasp social nuances and understand non-conventional choices.
    * Fam-robot (Windows) together with Corpo-Robot (Mac) and TechGuru-Robot (Linux) engage in a playful discussion, personifying the characteristics of different computer operating systems. Mac criticizes Windows for its inefficiency, Windows defends itself as the practical choice, and Linux boasts about its control and flexibility. Despite their differences, they ultimately acknowledge the value in appreciating each other's strengths and weaknesses, alluding to the coexistence of these operating systems in the tech world.
* New Robot Design
    * We've decided to create a family-friendly robot primarily aimed at kids. What better captures the essence of childhood than LEGO?
    * We plan to reuse our current base since its dimensions align with our new design, and we have ensured that all components were properly mounted.
