### Autonomous Robots as Performing Agents, Karl R. Wurst and Robert McCartney

The text introduces a captivating concept of autonomous agents equipped with processors and a physical presence, all designed for live performances. This  idea brings together the realms of AI, robotics, and puppetry, coining the term "puppotics".

The communication complexities among these performing agents are a central focus of this text, with discussions on how to coordinate actions effectively. This intricate web of communication involves interactions not only between the agents themselves but also with directors and the audience, all while maintaining the illusion of a natural and flowing performance.

The text also delves into the inspiration drawn from the virtual "Woggles," which are video actors characterized by distinct personalities and gestures. The research team's aspiration is to recreate the essence of these virtual characters using physical devices, emphasizing the importance of gestures and non-verbal communication in their performances.

As I read this text, I couldn't help but draw parallels to the technology presented in the series "Westworld." In the world of "Westworld," AI-enhanced robots are immersed in a Wild West-themed park, where they interact with humans, often blurring the lines between reality and AI. To achieve the immersive experience of a true "Westworld" it becomes apparent that AI robots must be capable of realistically and seamlessly interacting with people. This convergence of AI and entertainment, as explored in both the text and "Westworld," presents a fascinating starting point to the possibilities and challenges at the intersection of robotics and storytelling in the world of entertainment.
