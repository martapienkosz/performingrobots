### Nam June Paik, Marta Pienkosz

Nam June Paik, often celebrated as the "father of video art," is renowned for his innovative, Neo-Dadaist fusion of technology, experimentation, and performance. Yet, his legacy transcends the realm of media art, extending into the profound impact of his multidisciplinary approach and forward-thinking technological experiments on contemporary art. Paik's artistic endeavors provide a unique lens through which to contemplate the intricate interplay between humanity and machines. It is within this dynamic exchange that Paik's work resonates most deeply, challenging a reevaluation of human relationship with technology.

Born in Seoul, Paik moved with his family to Hong Kong during the outbreak of the Korean War, before ultimately settling in Tokyo in 1950. There, he enrolled in the Music, Art History, and Aesthetics program at Tokyo University. After graduating in 1956, driven by his passion for Western classical music, he made a pivotal decision to pursue further studies in Germany under the composers Thrasybulus Georgiades and Wolfgang Fortner (Yun 16). In Germany, he immersed himself in the avant-garde landscapes of art and music, exploring visionary works of John Cage and Joseph Beuys.

Nam June Paik's approach to music was nothing short of unique; he perceived it as a dynamic intervened force not merely meant for passive performance (Grunenberg & Wismer 9). Through experimentation with manipulating television images, Paik redirected his focus from music to a multidisciplinary, object-based fine art practice, exploring social, political, and technological progress (Yun 16). His early works in performance and video art drew the attention of the New York Fluxus movement's leader (1964), leading to collaborations with prominent American artists like John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Yoko Ono, and Bill Viola.

Right from the beginning, Paik envisioned his art objects incorporating electronic components for interactivity, aiming to provide the public with unrestricted, participatory access to art (Yun 15). Much like his avant-garde contemporaries, he aimed to deconstruct the prevailing elitism within the fine art world (Yun 16). His works encompass a wide range of philosophical and theoretical explorations, drawing from Zen Buddhism, Marshall McLuhan’s communication theory and Norbert Wiener’s cybernetics thesis, establishing a unique understanding of the meaning of art in the electronics age (Lee 27).

His overarching philosophy on technology, particularly its relationship to the human body, reflected his aspiration to humanize technology and his foresight on the seamless integration of technological innovations into daily life (Yun 15). In a 1974 essay, Paik proposed 'Electronic Super Highways' that could connect distant cities through satellites, cables, and fiber optics, foreshadowing a global digital network— the Internet (Zinman). While many of his predictions regarding the intertwining of electronics with daily life have become reality, it's the enduring spirit and artistic ideals of Paik that continue to infuse contemporary culture with the language of avant-gardism (Lee 27).
One of the most striking examples of Paik's exploration of the relationship between humanity and machines is evident in his performance-based projects featuring Robot K-456 in the late 1960s. Created in collaboration with Shuya Abe in 1964, this robot took its name from Mozart's concerto No. 18 in B-flat major, K. 456 (Yun 18). Originally designed with a hermaphroditic appearance, it stood at approximately six feet in height, revealing a framework of aluminum parts bolted together (Brrett 56). Its arms, head, and torso were linked to servo motors, allowing limited motion with a twenty-channel radio controller.

Paik's choice to exclude sensors or feedback mechanisms, and the subsequent reliance on human assistance, renders the robot as functionally ‘useless’. However, K-456 shares a common thread with contemporary cybernetic robotics by aiming to simulate human experiences (Brett 61). It possesses the capacity for both performance and refusal, a characteristic especially evident during the "First Accident of the Twenty-First Century" performance (1982). During this incident, the manually controlled robot fell victim of a staged car accident while attempting to cross 75th street. Paik's robotics work thus delves not only into the posthuman birth of the human but also its technological crisis, even its imminent death (ibid). To Paik this event is a symbol of the "catastrophe of technology in the twentieth century," serving as a poignant reminder of technology's limitations and emphasizing the importance of prioritizing humanity over scientific innovations (Yun 19).

This performance reveals two contrasting ideas that both challenge and confirm the distinctions between humans and machines. On one hand, the robot is portrayed as autonomous, mimicking the human capacity for vulnerability, self-negation, and the ability to make radical choices, even to the extent of refusal or self-destruction (Brett 74). On the other hand, it stages the robot's attempt to break free from the captivity of human control, revealing that it doesn't act fully autonomously but rather is manipulated by external forces or the will of another (ibid). This dual portrayal blurs the line between humans and machines, raising compelling questions about the robot's true agency.
Nam June Paik's artistic vision invites us to not only appreciate his pioneering work in the context of his time but also to project it into the future. In an era defined by the rapid evolution of technology, his explorations provide a foundation upon which one can build a deeper understanding of the interactions between humans and machines, offering valuable insights into how we can shape this relationship to preserve the essence of our humanity.
